# 🧪 Exercise 1: Reusable Components

## Goal
Stop copy-pasting code! Refactor the hardcoded `UserCard` component to be reusable.

## Steps

1. Modify `UserCard` to accept `name` and `role` as props.

2. In `App.js`, render **3 distinct users** (e.g., Teacher, Student, Developer) reusing that single component.
